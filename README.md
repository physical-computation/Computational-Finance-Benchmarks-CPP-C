# Computational Finance Benchmarks
These computational finance C++ benchmarks are adapted from Python code from a course by Lech A. Grzelak: https://github.com/LechGrzelak/Computational-Finance-Course/tree/main

# C++ Computational Finance Benchmarks

To compile the C++ versions of the benchmarks type: ```g++ -std=c++11 <name of benchmark>``` in the directory of the benchmark you want to compile. 
To run the compiled benchmark type: ```./a.out``` in the directory of the benchmark you just compiled. All benchmarks have 25 paths and 500 steps. 
You can edit the variables ```NoOfPaths``` and ```NoOfSteps``` to increase or decrease the number of paths and steps in each benchmark.
